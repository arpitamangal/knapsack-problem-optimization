        "Consider a thief who goes into a warehouse with a knapsack. There is a limit to how much weight the knapsack can carry. The warehouse has many items, each of which is divisible into arbitrarily small fragments eg. gold, silver, diamond dust, etc. The thief wants to fill her knapsack with the most profitable bundle of goods. How can she decide what this bundle is?\n",
        "\n",
        "The first stage in solving an optimization problem is modeling. And the very first as well as the most important step in modeling is to name your quantities. Let the knapsack capacity be W lbs. Let N denote the number of goods in the warehouse. Let the total weight of the ith good be wi and let the value of the ith good be vi.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next step is to decide what quantities we are free to choose. These are known as decision variables. In this case, the thief must decide how much of each item to carry. Let xi denote the fraction of the ith good carried away by the thief.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next two steps in modeling an optimization problem are to decide what our goals and restrictions are. The goal is commonly referred to as an objective function which we need to either maximize or minimize depending on the problem. In this case, the objective function is sum(vi*xi), which is the total profit made by the thief, and we need to maximize the objective function. The restrictions are that \n",
        "(a) the thief can not take more of a good than is available in the warehouse, and \n",

This would result in a situation where we could subtract infinitely many items from the knapsack, which would lead to an unbounded objective function. This means that the optimal solution does not exist, and the linear optimization problem would have no feasible solution.\n",

        "\n",
        "We observe that, gold is the only item that is partially chosen, while diamonds are completely left behind, and silver is fully selected. There is only one best solution to solve this particular knapsack problem. In order to fully determine the values of the three variables, we require three linear equations. Therefore, we need at least three of our inequalities to be satisfied with equality, which means they must be tight. One of the condition is the total weight must not exceed the capacity of the knapsack. We need two more conditions. It is impossible for x1 to be both greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1 at the same time, and the same is true for x2 and x3. Therefore, each item can only contribute to one tight constraint. As a result, two different items must contribute to the two tight constraints, which means neither of those items can be selected partially. This leaves only one item that can be chosen partially in the optimal solution. Therefore, in order to determine an optimal solution it is practically important to have only one good chosen fractionally."
